## Installation troubleshooting based on the Helm chart {#troubleshooting-helm-chart}

<div class ='faq'>

### In case there is a `whatap` Helm repository with the same name

| "whatap" already exists with the same configuration, skipping |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- |

If another `whatap` repository with the same name already exists, delete the existing `whatap` repository by using the following command and then proceed with installation.

```shell
helm repo remove whatap
```

### In case there is another namespace named `whatap-monitoring` in the cluster

| Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: Unable to continue with install: Namespace "whatap-monitoring" in namespace "" exists and cannot be imported into the current release |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

If the `whatap-monitoring` namespace exists in the cluster, it is because the user has already installed the Whatap Kubernetes agent based on the _yaml_ file. In this case, delete the existing `whatap-monitoring` namespace and related resources by using the following commands.

```shell
kubectl delete namespace whatap-monitoring
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding whatap
kubectl delete clusterrole whatap
```

### In case the `clusterrole` and `clusterrolebinding` resources exist in the cluster

| Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: Unable to continue with install: ClusterRole "whatap" in namespace "" exists and cannot be imported into the current release |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

If the `clusterrole` and `clusterrolebinding` resources already exist in the cluster, delete them by using the following commands.

```shell
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding whatap
kubectl delete clusterrole whatap
```
