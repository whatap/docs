At the bottom of ***Management*** > ***Agent installation***, click ***Install Application*** > Select the ***Docker PHP*** tab in Install guide.

This process applies the WhaTap monitoring agent to the PHP application running on the Docker container and packages the container image as follows. 

:::note 

EKS Fargate is to be supported later.

## Download agent

Install the whatap-php package when building your PHP application docker image.

<TabItem value="rc" label="Red Hat/CentOS" default>

```docker title='Red Hat/CentOS'

RUN rpm -Uvh https://repo.whatap.io/centos/5/noarch/whatap-repo-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
RUN yum install -y whatap-php

```

RUN tar -xvzf whatap-php.tar.gz -C /

```

## Agent CONFIG.

-   Use the following command to set the installation script. If you enter the WhaTap access key and server IP, the PHP environment data is automatically collected.

    ```docker
    RUN (echo "[granted access key]"; echo "[granted server IP]")|/usr/whatap/php/install.sh
    ```

-   Using the following method, you can directly enter the PHP environment settings. 

    ```docker
    # RUN /usr/whatap/php/install.sh -l [granted access key] -s [granged server IP] -v [PHP version x.x] -i [the full path of php.ini] -p [process name] -z [thread safety]
    RUN /usr/whatap/php/install.sh -l xxxxx -s 1.1.1.1/2.2.2.2 -v 7.0 -i /etc/php.ini -p httpd [-z]
    ```

:::note 

Be careful not to expose the **access key** to images that are in Docker Public status.

:::

## Configuring the container environment variables

After building Docker, set **container environment variables** in the Kubernetes environment. Add the following items in the *yaml* file for releasing the application. 

```yaml

env:
- name: NODE_IP
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
- name: NODE_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}

```

See the following example: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: # Pod Name
  labels: # Pod Labels
spec:
  containers:
	  env:
    - name: NODE_IP
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: status.hostIP}}
    - name: NODE_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: spec.nodeName}}
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom: {fieldRef: {fieldPath: metadata.name}}
```

:::note 

**Roles of environment variables**

-   `NODE_IP`: Collects the IP address of the node where the current Pod has been hosted.

-   `NODE_NAME`: Collects the name of the node where the current Pod is running.

-   `POD_NAME`: Collects the name of the current Pod.

:::

## Running the agent

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cm" label="Command" default>

Add the whatap-php startup command before the application startup command. 

```docker'
sh -c "/usr/whatap/php/whatap-php start && [application startup command]"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sup" label="Supervisor" default>

In case of starting the application as supervisor, see the following code to add the whatap-php service.

```docker

RUN echo "[program:whatap-php]" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "command = /usr/whatap/php/whatap-php start" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "user = root" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "autostart = true" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "autorestart = true" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stdout_logfile = /dev/stdout" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stdout_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stderr_logfile = /dev/stderr" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf
RUN echo "stderr_logfile_maxbytes=0" >> /etc/supervisor/conf.d/whatap.conf

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Execute the following command to check whether the WhaTap service has been run normally. When the application server runs, it begins collecting monitoring information.

```docker

ps -ef | grep whatap_php

```

## Checking the agent installation

To check whether the agent has been installed, go to ***Dashboard*** > ***Application Service Dashboard***.

If you have manually installed the downloaded file but cannot see the agent in ***Dashboard***, check the following.

-   Execute the command, `ps -ef | grep whatap` in the container, and then check whether the agent options have been applied properly.

-   Check the content of the container in the */usr/whatap/php/logs* path. The file name of the agent log is displayed as *logs/`{boot or install}`-yyyymmdd.log*.
